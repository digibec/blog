<h3> Post #2: Ideating, Researching & Going Insane </h3>

<p> This is a new paragraph </p>

<p> For the last week I've been batting around various final project concepts in my head. Going into last Tuesday's class, I had close to six different concepts in mind, and through our "speed dating" exercise, I managed to whittle dowm my selection to two that I thought were solid and had legs. The only main challenge or conundrum I was faced with was how to leverage or involve some sort of map as part of the project.</p>

<p> Why you ask did I need to involve a map? Well, because we've been focusing much of our class on the use of maps to visualize data, and because the use of sort some of map visualization is a requirement of the project.</p>

<p> The problem is that I could not find a connection between either of my refined ideas and a prototyping map.</p> 

<p>The first idea centered on rethinking or redesigning the airplane onboarding and deboarding process. I don't think anyone in this day and age believes that getting on and off an airplane is a logical, orderly, efficient experience and I believe there is great room for improvement in this area from a efficiency gaining perspective and a pleasant experience perspective. </p>

<p> The second concept involves the redesign of our classroom in the Lazarus building. The current layout, features, functionality, ambience, etc. is unuseful, cramped, unoriginal and plain just boring. My plan was to do user research like surveys, interviews, ethnographies, etc. with students, professors, administrators, etc. to ideate on what the ideal classroom layout, look and feel, technology, etc. would be. </p>

<p> Without having any real idea on how a map could be utilized, leveraged or created for these concepts. I finally selected the MAMBA classroom layout because I'm personally more interested in project on a personal impact and because I think it will be extremely interesting to apply the design thinking process to develop a potential classroom for design thinking students. </p>

<p> My first step is to design a survey to be sent to current  and former MAMBA students to assess their thoughts, feelings and experiences with our current classroom, and to have them ideate on what it could potentially be or could potentially house. The survey should launch sometime this week</p>

<p> How will I incorporate a map or maps into the project? Well... I don't at present believe there will be any sort of tradition geogrpahic map, but in my research this week I've uncovered and thought of other types of maps and visualization types I believe will be very useful in this project. More to come and the following weeks as I research, uncover insights and prototype my project. </p>


<h3>Post #1 : Learning Code &amp; Website Infrastructure </h3>

<p>It only took me 5 days of repeated failures that involved deleting all my files, starting over, searching Google for what I messed up, watching Lynda tutorials on repeat and generally picking myself up off the floor after miserable failings and pushing on. But finally - FINALLY! - I figured out how to connect Dreamweaver to my Github account, so I could 1) establish a blog for my Visualization &amp; Protoytping class and 2) use both platforms to legit learn how to code. 
</p>

<p>While I had periods of immense frustration and hairpulling, I came to realize that the best way to learn was through trial and error, repeat infinite amount of times, learn, grow, mess up again and again, finally figure something out, and then do right.</p>

<p> That being said, I am about 40% confident that this blog posting will actually see the published light of day because, despite the best of my efforts, I'm not sure my GitHub account and Mac App is correctly set up.</p>
