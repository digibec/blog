<h1>Ups, Downs &amp; In Betweens</h1>
<h2> ~ My Pursuits in Visualization & Prototyping ~ </h2>
<h3>Posting #1 : Learning Code &amp; Website Infrastructure </h3>
<p>It only took me 5 days of repeated failures that involved deleting all my files, starting over, searching Google for what I messed up, watching Lynda tutorials on repeat and generally picking myself up off the floor after miserable failings and pushing on. But finally - FINALLY! - I figured out how to connect Dreamweaver to my Github account, so I could 1) establish a blog for my Visualization &amp; Protoytping class and 2) use both platforms to legit learn how to code. 
</p>
<p>While I had periods of immense frustration and hairpulling, I came to realize that the best way to learn was through trial and error, repeat infinite amount of times, learn, grow, mess up again and again, finally figure something out, and then do right.</p>
<p> That being said, I am about 40% confident that this blog posting will actually see the published light of day because, despite the best of my efforts, I'm not sure my GitHub account and Mac App is correctly set up.</p>
